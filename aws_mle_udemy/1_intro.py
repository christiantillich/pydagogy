# Objective

Outline the course, provide the location to course materials, and give some 
pointers on working with Udemy in general. 

### Notes on Udemy

Some useful features to remember:

1. There's a Q&A section. You can post a question and browse questions that 
    others have asked
1. There's a speed function, you can slow down the lecture
1. Probably want to turn on subtitles too.

[Course Slides](http://media.sundog-soft.com/AWSMachineLearning/AWSCertifiedMLSlides.pdf)

Remember that following along with an AWS console _will_ incur charges, as AWS
services are not free. The course notes that on average they spend about $5 per
week to follow along.
